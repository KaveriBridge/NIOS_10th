# AGRICULTURE IN INDIA
## Objectives
After studying this lesson you will be able to:
* explain various types of farming in India;
* describe salient features of Indian agriculture;
* list the major crops grown in India along with their utility;
* establish relationship of crops with the types of soil and climatic conditions;
* locate major crop producing areas on the outline map of India, and
* analyse challenges faced by farmers in Indian agriculture.

## Major type of farming
* Subsistence farming - for own consumption vs  Commercial farming - for selling in the market.
* Intensive and Extensive Farming: The basic difference between these two types of farming is the amount of production per unit of land. 
* Plantation Farming: An estate where a single cash crop is grown for sale.
* Mixed Farming: Raising crops and rearing animals carried on simultaneously


## Subsistence vs Commercial Farming

| Farming Type                  | Subsistence Farming | Commercial Farming |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Definition                    | Farming for own consumption; no surplus to sell in the market | Produce sold in the market for earning money |
| Farmer's Consumption          | Majority of production is consumed by farmers and their family | Only a portion of the produce is consumed by the farmers |
| Landholdings                  | Small and fragmented | - |
| Cultivation Techniques        | Primitive and simple | Modern techniques used |
| Equipment                     | Absence of modern equipment like tractors | Equipment like irrigation, chemical fertilizers, insecticides, pesticides used |
| Crops Grown                   | Mostly cereals, oil seeds, pulses, vegetables, and sugarcane | Major commercial crops such as cotton, jute, sugarcane, groundnut |

## Intensive vs Extensive farming
| Farming Type             | Intensive Farming | Extensive Farming |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Definition               | High production per unit of land | Large area used for cultivation |
| Examples                 | Japan, limited availability of land | Temperate areas of USA, Canada, and former USSR |
| Comparison to India      | Practiced in limited areas like Kerala | Not commonly practiced in India |
| Total Production         | High due to intensive cultivation | High due to larger area |
| Production per Unit Area | High | Low |

## Various revolutions in India
| Revolution       | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Green Revolution | Technological breakthrough based on improved seeds of high yielding varieties, adequate and assured water supply, and increased use of fertilizers |
| White Revolution | Remarkable increase in milk production  |
| Blue Revolution  | Significant increase in freshwater and marine fish catch                                                                                          |
| Yellow Revolution| Steady and assured supply of poultry products                                                                                                      |
| Pink Revolution  | Rise in apple production, particularly in Himachal Pradesh and J&K states                                                           |


## Salient features of Indian agriculture
* (a) Subsistence Agriculture: 
* (b) Pressure of population on Agriculture: ~70% of population is still directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture.
* (c) Mechanization of farming: complete mechanization is still a distant dream
* (d) Dependence upon monsoon: Two third of cropped areas is still dependent upon monsoon
* (e) Variety of crops: India has diversity of topography, climate and soil. 
* (f) Predominance of food crops
* (g) Seasonal patterns: India has three distinct agricultural/cropping seasons - kharif, rabi and zaid.

## Groundnut - The most important oilseed of India
| Aspect                       | Description                                                                                           |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Growing Seasons              | Kharif (90-95% of total area) and Rabi crop                                                           |
| Temperature                  | Thrives best in tropical climate, requires 20°C to 30°C                                                 |
| Rainfall                     | 50-75 cm rainfall favorable, susceptible to frost, prolonged drought, continuous rain, and stagnant water |
| Soil                         | Well-drained light sandy loams, red, yellow, and black soils                                           |
| Distribution in India        | Most important oilseed in India, accounts for about half of major oilseeds produced                     |
| India's Production           | Largest producer of groundnut in the world, accounting for about one third of global production         |
| Major Producers in India     | Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Gujarat (60% of total production)                                     |
| Other Producers in India     | Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Odisha (30% of total production)                                           |

##  MAJOR CHALLENGES FACED BY INDIAN AGRICULTURE
* 1. Stagnation in Production of Major Crops: 
* 2. High cost of Farm Inputs: 
* 3. Soil Exhaustion: 
* 4. Depletion of Fresh Ground Water
* 5. Adverse impact of Global Climatic Change
* 6. Impact of Globalisation 
* 7. Providing Food Security:
