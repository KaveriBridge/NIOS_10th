## What is octet rule?
* Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons in order to achieve a stable electron configuration similar to that of the noble gases. 
* Atoms are most stable when their outermost energy level is fully filled with eight electrons.

## What is the meaning of having an octet?
* Atoms are said to have an octet, when their outermost energy level is fully filled with either two or eight electrons.

## Why are inert gases stable?
* Because they have fully filled valence shells, which makes it very stable.

## Inert gases

## What is the cause of chemical bonding?
* The basic cause of chemical bonding is to attain noble gas configuration either by transfer of electron from a metal to non- metal or by sharing of electrons between two non-metal atoms.

## Why are chemical bonds stable?
* The resulting compound is lower in energy as compared to sum of energies of the reacting atom/molecule and hence is more stable.

## What is an ionic bond?
### Short answer
* The chemical bond formed by transfer of electron(s) from a metal to a non- metal is known as ionic or electrovalent bond.
### Long answer
* An ionic bond is a type of chemical bond formed between two atoms with significantly different electronegativities. 
* In an ionic bond, one atom (usually a metal) donates electrons to another atom (usually a non-metal), resulting in the formation of positively charged cations and negatively charged anions. 
* These oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other by electrostatic forces, creating a strong bond between them.
