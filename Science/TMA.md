### (b) The car is parked in the sun by Sunil, and he completely closes the doors, and windows of the car for safety. After some time opening the doors of the car, he realizes that the temperature inside the car was higher than the temperature outside. Explain that due to which effect of heat this happened. If the car is completely covered with white cloth, then there will be any effect in the internal temperature of that car, if yes, explain the reason.  (See lesson 14)

## 2. Answer any one of the following questions in about 40- 60 words.
### (a) In the winter season, fire is used as heat to escape from the cold.
