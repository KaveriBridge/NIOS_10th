## Summary
* The issue of ‘choice’ arises, because a) the resources are scarce and b) the resources can be put to many alternative uses.
* An economy confronts three fundamental economic problems, what goods and services to produce, how to produce and for whom to produce.
* Capitalist economy is an economic system in which factors of production are privately owned and goods and services are produced with the objective of
earning maximum profit.
*  In a planned economic system, there is a central planning authority of the government which decides what to produce, how to produce and for whom to
produce.
* A mixed economic system combines government planning with the free market economy.
*  For the growth of any economy, the resources available to the economy like labour, capital and technology should grow.
*  If all the resources in the economy are fully employed, then the quantity of one commodity can be increased only by forgoing the quantity of other. This happens
when production takes places efficiently.
*  If the scarce resources are also not utilized fully, it is wastage of resources. Thus it is the duty of an economy to ensure that the scarce resources do not remain
unutilized or under-utilised

## Terminal exercise
1. Central problem of an economy arise, because:
- I. Many goods are sold in market
- II. Government makes decisions
- III. Shortage of labour
- IV. Multiplicity of wants and scarcity of resources
2. Choice is fundamental to economic behavior, because:
- I. People find it difficult to choose what they want
- II. Resources are scarce in relation to people’s wants
- III. People behave rationally
- IV. Price of a commodity depends on choice
3. Explain how scarcity and choice go together?
4. Why it is said that free market economy ensures most efficient allocation of resources?
5. Explain the three central problems with one suitable example of each.
